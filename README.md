# Landing Page Project

A responsive landing page developed using vanilla [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). The page builds it's navigation menu dynamically by iterating all available `<section>` tags within the `content-grid-container` `<div>`.
